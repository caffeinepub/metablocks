  "summary": "The diff updates the app router to make Metablocks the '/' hub, adds first-class routes for six Metablocks modes, updates the shared header title to “Metablocks”, and updates the hub page to render Metablocks branding imagery and six mode tiles with navigation plus a Leaderboard button. However, the required generated asset files are not added in the diff, and the mode icon filenames used in HubPage do not match the BuildRequest’s specified filenames.",
