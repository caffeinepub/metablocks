  "summary": "Diff implements a new PS PUZZLE hub at '/' with 5 puzzle tiles and adds 5 puzzle mini-game pages with start/reset, completion states, numeric scoring, back-to-hub navigation, and signed-in gated score saving via a new hook. However, the generated static image assets themselves are not evidenced as added, and there are unrequested/constraint-violating changes to authentication/actor-related hooks and URL param utilities.",

      "requirement": "Add the newly generated PS PUZZLE branding and puzzle icons under frontend/public/assets/generated and use them in the hub UI (static files, not backend-served).",
      "reason": "HubPage references the generated image paths, but the diff summary does not show any added files under frontend/public/assets/generated (only code files were added/modified). Without the actual static assets present, this requirement is not fully implemented.",
